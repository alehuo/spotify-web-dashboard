# Spotify Web Dashboard

## Introduction

This repository contains a Spotify Web Dashboard implementation, built with React. The main motivation for this project was just to test things out and to get familiar with the Spotify SDK.

## Features

- View the current song's information
- Start playing a playlist
- Spotify Web Playback SDK functionality is implemented, but I've had no time to test it out. In theory, you should be able to stream the tracks via the dashboard.

## Installation instructions

You need to create a new application in https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard to get the Client ID.

- Run `yarn install`
- Set environment variables (see `.env.example`)
- Run `yarn start`
